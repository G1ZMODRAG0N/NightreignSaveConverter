####FAQ####

- What is this? 
A short powershell script to quickly convert and backup Elden Ring Nightreign save files for the Seemless duo mod.

- Can't I just rename the extension of the file myself? 
Yeah you could do that, but this saves you the trouble of going through nested folders. aka APPDATA

- Is this safe?
Converting from Vanilla to Seemless is perfectly safe. However there is the concern of unknown items being added to the save file. As of now, to my knowledge, there are no differences between save files and the .co2 file is just a safety for players using the mod. Use at your own risk if you wish to convert from Seemless to Vanilla.

####HOW TO####

1. Extract all contents of the .rar file. Doesn't matter where.

2. Run the "run.bat" file. It will launch the script.

3. The script will automatically check for a backup folder. If there is not one it will create a save backup folder with all your current save files. If there is already a backup file it will ask if you would like to overwrite them.

4. It will list all of your current saves for both Seemless and Vanilla. Including dates and times of when they were last written.

5. Select an option: convert vanilla, convert seemless, restore vanilla backup, or restore seemless backup.

6. Thats it.
